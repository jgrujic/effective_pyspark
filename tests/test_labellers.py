    # Notes: this test highlights well that tests are a form of up-to-date documentation.
    # It also protects somewhat against future changes (what if someone changes the
    # label_holidays to reflect the holidays of France?
    # Additionally, with the test written out already, you do not have to go into
    # your main function and write `print` everywhere as you are developing it. In fact,
    # most likely, you would have written out at some point something similar to this test,
    # put it in __main__ and once you noticed it succeeded, you would 've removed it. That's
    # so unfortunate! The automated test would've been lost and you force someone else to
    # have to rewrite it.
